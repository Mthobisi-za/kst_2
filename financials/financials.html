                The trustees are responsible for the maintenance of adequate accounting records and the preparation and integrity of the financial statements consisting of the statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in
                equity, statement of cash flows, notes to the financial statements and related information. The auditors are responsible to report on the fair presentation of the financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
                with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). <br> <br> The trustees are also responsible for the trust's system of internal financial controls. These are designed and implemented by management to provide reasonable,
                but not absolute, assurance as to the integrity and reliability of the financial statements, and to adequately safeguard, verify and maintain accountability of assets, and to prevent and detect misstatement and loss. Nothing has come to
                the attention of the trustees to indicate that any material breakdown in the functioning of these controls, procedures and systems has occurred during the period under review. <br> <br> The preparation and presentation of financial statements
                in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
                expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. <br> <br> The trustees have a reasonable expectation that the trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
                For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. <br> <br> The financial statements as set out on pages 8 to 24 have been audited by independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Incorporated,
                which was given unrestricted access to all financial controls and related data, including minutes of all meetings of trustees, the board of trustees and committees of the board. The trustees believe that all representations made to the
                independent auditors during the audit are valid and appropriate. <br> <br> <br> <strong> APPROVAL OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</strong> <br> The financial statements of the trust for the year ended 31 March 2022, which are set out
                on pages 8 to 24 were approved by the board of trustees on 30 November 2022 and are signed on its behalf by:

                The trustees present their annual report of the trust for the year ended 31 March 2022. <br> <br><strong> Country of incorporation and domicile</strong> <br> South Africa <br> <br> <strong>Nature of business</strong> <br> The principal
                activity of the trust is to assist schools in need by mobilising resources from individuals and companies willing to invest in the development of South Africa's future human capital. <br> <br> <strong> Trustees: </strong> <br> The following
                trustees were in office during the year: Mankodi Magdeline Moitse <br> Julian Dominque Mixon <br> Yvonne Nokukhanya Themba <br> Steven Lebere <br> Patience Baloyi (Resigned 30 April 2021) <br> Tracey Henry (Resigned 08 June 2022) <br>                Jonas Themba Mola <br> Mzomhle Patrick Nyenjana <br> Mmabatho Nthabiseng Maboya <br> <br>
                <strong>Subsequent events</strong> <br> The Free State Department of Education has notified KST Trust that they will not be providing funding for the 31 March 2023 Financial year. The trust is currently wrapping up Infrastructure projects
                at Motheo district and Fezile Dabi district till the end of December 2022. <br> <br>
                <strong>Going concern</strong> <br> The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies applicable to a going concern. This basis presumes that funds will be available to finance future operations and that the
                realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities, contingent obligations and commitments will occur in the ordinary course of business. <br> <br>
                <strong>Operating results </strong> <br> The financial position and operating results of the trust are fully set out on pages 8 to 24 of the financial statements and do not, in the opinion of the trustees, require any further comment.
